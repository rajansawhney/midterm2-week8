II. Area Calculator Menu Driven Program (55 points)

Write a C program that allows to calculate the area of multiple shapes depending on the option
selected by the user. Use functions to take the input from the user and to print the output of
the area calculator. 
As a reminder:
    - the area a of a circle is calculated as:
            a=p*r2      # where r is the radius of the circle
    - the area a of a square is calculated as:
            a=s*s       # where s is the side of the square
    - the area a of a sphere is calculated as:
            a=4*p*r2    # where r is the radius of the sphere
    Use p (pi) as 3.14


Note:
1. Program should accept only positive integers. Check for negative integers.
2. Display output as:
        The area of a <shape> of <radius/side> <input> is equal to: <area>
3. Calculated area must have only two decimal places

Example:
Press 1 to calculate the area of a circle.
Press 2 to calculate the area of a square.
Press 3 to calculate the area of a sphere.

Enter your choice: 1

Enter radius: 5

The area of a circle of radius 5 is equal to: 78.50
