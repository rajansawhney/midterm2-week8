# ICS 212
## Midterm1- Week 8

### Instructions:
- Update the program files following instructions provided in Midterm_Week8.pdf (uploaded on Laulima) and in the program comments.

**NOTE**: 
- Github is not a place to test your code. Test it on your machines first. Do not exceed 10 commits. If you exceed 10 commits, your grade will be penalized.
- Do not edit Makefile, test.sh, and files in test folder

### Steps to submit changes:
1. Click on desired .c to open file
2. Click the pencil icon to edit file on the top right
3. Update the file with your code following homework assignment description
4. Once you are ready to submit your changes, click on the green "Commit changes..." button on the top right
5. Enter a commit message that describes your changes in a few words - eg: added printf statement
6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch"
7. Click on "Commit Changes" button. Your code changes have been submitted!

### To check whether your code changes passed:
1. Click on "Actions" on the top
2. Click on the latest workflow from the list
3. Click on "Autograding"
4. Expand the desired section. If your code did not pass, you will expand "Run education/autograding@v1" and see the error message.

### Note:
We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly. You should always test on your laptop first, and then copy the finished code to github. Test your program on your machine using the instructions you received in the lab sessions.

If your code did not pass, revise your code and submit(commit) your changes again.

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed.

You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.

For any questions, please reach out to Dr. Katy Tarrit (katytm7@hawaii.edu) AND Rajan Sawhney (rsawhney@hawaii.edu)
