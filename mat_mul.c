I. Multiplication of two matrices (45 points)

Write a C program that asks the user to enter the size (number of rows and columns) of two matrices.
- To multiply two matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix needs to be equal to the number 
    of rows of the second matrix. The program asks for the number of rows and columns until the above 
    condition is satisfied.
- Then, the program performs the multiplication of two matrices and display the resulting on the screen.
    To perform this, you will must use multiple functions:
    1. one to take the matrix elements provided by the user,
    2. another to multiply the two matrices 
    3. and one to display the resulting matrix after multiplication.

Note:
1. Input integers in the following order only:
    - size of the two arrays
    - elements of the two arrays
2. Display elements of the resulting matrix using the following printf format only:
    printf("%4d", <elements of resulting matrix>)

Example:
Enter rows and column for the first matrix: 2 2
Enter rows and column for the second matrix: 2 2

Elements of the first matrix: 1 2 3 4
Elements of the second matrix: 1 2 3 4

Result of matrix multiplication:
   7   10 
  15   22
