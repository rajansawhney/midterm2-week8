II. Simple Banking System (65 points)

Write a C program that simulates a simple banking system. The program should allow users to perform the following operations:
1. Check balance
2. Deposit funds
3. Withdraw funds
4. Exit

Requirements:
1. Create a function for each operation (Check balance, Deposit, Withdraw).
2. Implement a function for displaying the menu and getting the user's choice.
3. Use a switch-case statement to perform the selected operation.
4. Keep track of the user's balance in a variable.
5. Ensure that withdrawals cannot exceed the available balance.
6. Display the balance after each operation.
Hint: You can create functions for checking the balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds, each updating the balance accordingly.
Use a switch-case statement to call the appropriate operation function based on the user's choice.

Note:
- Display balance with only two decimal places.

Example:
Simple Banking System Menu:
1. Check balance
2. Deposit funds
3. Withdraw funds
4. Exit
