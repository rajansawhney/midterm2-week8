/*
III. BONUS - Transpose a matrix (15 points)

Write a C program that allows to transpose a matrix.
The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix that is obtained by exchanging the rows and columns.
The user provides the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns).
The user is then asked to provide the elements of the matrix. 
The program then computes the transpose of the matrix and prints the resulting matrix.

Note:
1. Input integers in the following order only:
    - size of the array (rows and then columns)
    - elements of the array
2. Display elements of the transposed matrix using the following printf format only:
    printf("%4d", <elements of transposed matrix>)
